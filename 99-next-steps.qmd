# Next Steps {.unnumbered}

Thanks for attending our one-day *Introduction to Data Science with Python* course. We hope you enjoyed this glimpse into one of the most widely used programming languages for Data Science, and many applications beyond.

We would love to hear your feedback on this course and the course format. Please take a minute to write a short email to Lukas JÃ¼rgensmeier ([send me an email](mailto:juergensmeier@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de)) with three things you liked about this course, three things you disliked, and --- if possible --- a comment on how we should further develop this course for future audiences.

Thanks again for your time! We hope that you will find your newly acquired skills helpful in future projects.
