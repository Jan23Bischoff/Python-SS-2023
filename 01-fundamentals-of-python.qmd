Let's get started with the course contents!
In this first part of the course, we will give an introduction to programming with Python.
You will learn the fundamentals of Python and apply your new skills in small exercises.
After you got up to speed, we will have an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks --- an interactive environment to write, execute, and comment, and share Python code and results.
