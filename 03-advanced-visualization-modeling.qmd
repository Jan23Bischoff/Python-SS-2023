# Advanced Vizualization & Modeling

Two out of three --- done! Now, let's get to the last part of the course.
And maybe the most exciting part: advanced visualization with `seaborn` and some fancy machine learning modeling with `scikit-learn` (we admit, it's just a regression --- but the neural networks or gradient boosting algorithms are just a couple of code lines away).
