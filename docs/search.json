Now, let’s learn how to wrangle and visualize data.\nThis second part of the course covers two external libraries: numpy and pandas. Both are essential workhorses of data wrangling with Python. numpy is a library for scientific computing and many other libraries are built on top of this one. pandas is a data analysis and manipulation tool and the best choice when working with tabular data. At the end of this lecture we will also introduce and use matplotlib for simple plotting."

This course will introduce programming with Python and how to use it for data analysis. After successfully completing this course, you will be able to understand the fundamentals of the Python programming language. This skill set includes basic data analysis by data wrangling, data visualization, and implementing simple statistical models in Python.\nOur goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within Python and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your own empirical projects in Python."

The course takes place between 9:00 and 17:00, with a lunch and coffee breaks in between. We encourage you to attend in person, which makes the interaction and troubleshooting on your computer easier. However, if you cannot attend personally, you can join the course via this Zoom-Link.\nWe want you to make your hands dirty — that means we want you to code! Just following along fancy slides won’t magically transfer the skill of coding to you. But you actively engaging with the course content in your development environment will more likely do just that.\nThat’s why we need you to prepare accordingly: Please ensure that you have access to Google Colab before the course. We will use Google Colab for the coding parts, such that we can use Python without (sometimes time-consuming) pre-configuration or installation on your machine. To use Google colab, you need a Google account (same account which is used for Gmail, YouTube, etc.)\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to one of us through the e-mail addresses on the bottom of this page."
