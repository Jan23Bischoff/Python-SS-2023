# Data Wrangling & Visualization

You have just learned the basics of Python programming --- congrats! Now, let's learn how to wrangle and visualize data.

This second part of the course covers two external libraries: `numpy` and `pandas`. Both are essential workhorses of data wrangling with Python.
`numpy` is a library for scientific computing and many other libraries are built on top of this one. `pandas` is a data analysis and manipulation tool and the best choice when working with tabular data. At the end of this lecture we will also introduce and use `matplotlib` for simple plotting.
